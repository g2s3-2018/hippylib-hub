After changing the notebooks, cd into the codes/ directory and do an svn update.  
Then, cd back into this directory (cd ../) and update the temporary student.  First, rebuild the docker image:

docker build -t icerm/hippylib .

Then stop the current containers if they are running (this takes a few minutes):

./StopServer.sh

And restart the containers with the new image:

./StartServer.sh
